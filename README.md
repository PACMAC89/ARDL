# ARDL
Autoregressive Distributed Lags Approach long- and short run relationships between the U.S. stock market and selected Macroeconomic Variables

I applied the ARDL model and cointegration technique to analyse the following hypotheses
- negative relationship between the S&P 500 and inflation. 
- negative effect of the expected 10-year real interest rate on the S&P 500 index.
- positive effect of money aggregate M2 on the S&P 500 index. 
- positive effect of the industrial production on the S&P 500 index. 
- negative effect of the WTI crude oil price on the S&P 500 index. 

The following aspects were analyzed: 
- Unit root test
- ARDL Cointegration tests
- Short- and long-run relationships
- Error Correction - cointegration trajectories
- Granger-causality using F-statistics
- Diagnostic and stability test results
